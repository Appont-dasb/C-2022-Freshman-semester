# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: solve exam2022_problem

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.



//Distinguish between sizeof and strlen
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS 1
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
	char arr1[] = "abc" ;
	char arr2[] = {'a','b','c',0};
	printf("%d\n",strlen(arr1)); //output:3
	printf("%d\n",sizeof(arr1)); //output:4
  
  //why ?
	//For strlen, '0' is not counted towards the string length
	//However, for sizeof, the string length is still counted

	return 0;
}


If arr1 does not contain a 0.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
	char arr1[] = "abc" ;
	char arr2[] = {'a','b','c'};
	printf("%d\n",strlen(arr1)); //output:3
	printf("%d\n",sizeof(arr1)); //output:Random value
	it will be random value .
	
        return 0 ;
  }

'\0'是字符串结束的标志，不算做字符串的内容



//The job task before that

Class notes
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int a,b;
	scanf("%d",&a);
	if (a)
	{
		a=2;
		b=3;
	}
	else if(a==0)  //a这里得有==
	{
		b=2;
	}else 
	{
		b=1;
	}
	printf("%d",b);
	return 0;
}


Practice
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	float h = 0.15 ;
	int n = 0 ;

	while(h<=8844000)
	{
		h=2*h;
		n=n+1;
	}
	printf("%d",n) ;
	return 0;
}
